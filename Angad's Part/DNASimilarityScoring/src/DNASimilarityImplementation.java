/* Explanation:
 * This is the code implementation for the final portion of the course COMP 359 
 * (Design and Analysis of Algorithms). 
 * 
 * I chose to implement a topic that we learned about in COMP 359
 * that I found very interesting which is about how Dynamic Programming can be used
 * in find similarities between DNA Sequences. The code below is a Java implemenation
 * of this idea.
 * 
 * I would like to first give credit and reference the people who explained and 
 * implemented this in Python. I took inspiration and used their implemenation as a
 * resource to implement my version.
