Angad's Part:

Main Idea: A dynamic programming code implementation of measuring DNA Sequence Similarities for the final portion of the course COMP 359. 

I chose to implement a topic that we learned about in COMP 359 that I found very interesting which is about how Dynamic Programming can be used in find similarities between DNA Sequences. The code in this repository under the folder Angad's part includes a Java implemenation of this idea. 

I would like to give credit and reference the people who explained and implemented this in Python. I took inspiration and used their implemenation as a guide and resource to implement my version.
