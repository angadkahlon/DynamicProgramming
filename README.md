Angad's Part:

Main Idea: A dynamic programming code implementation of measuring DNA Sequence Similarities for the final portion of the course COMP 359. 

I chose to implement a topic that we learned about in COMP 359 that I found very interesting which is about how Dynamic Programming can be used in find similarities between DNA/RNA Sequences. The code in this repository under the folder Angad's part includes a Java implementation of this idea. 

Background Information:

DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (Ribonucleic Acid) are a huge part of life on Earth. They are strands of genetic data that carry immense amounts of information for organisms. These strands are made up of blocks called nucleotides. There are 4 different kinds of nucleotides A (adenine), T (thymine) which is actually U (uracil) in RNA due to some differences, C (cytosine), and G (guanine). These nucleotides pair up with each other: A and T/U pair up, while C and G pair up. These pairs from DNA and RNA sequences.

Calulating the similarites between two different DNA or RNA strands has important applications in the real world, such as understanding mutations, evolutions, protein development, and numerous others. 

The program created in this project takes two different DNA or RNA sequences, aligns them for maximum similarity of nucleotides, and returns the similarity between the strands including information about additions, deletions, or mutations between the strands.

I would like to give credit and reference the people who explained and implemented this in Python. I took inspiration and used their implementation as a guide and resource to implement my version.
